# Hey! 
## This is my AR project, working only on a Android smartphone. 
(and VR glasses)

It was written in Unity, by one schoolboy, so I recommend you to using my guide.

## If you want to just use it...
Select the "Releases" menu on the right side of your screen and download APK file from last release. Then install it on your phone and run. Interface in russian now, so, maybe you need a translator ;)

## If you want to compile this project...

!!USE UNITY 2022.3.35f1!!

Set Unity config like this:
